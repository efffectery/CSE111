Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

I really enjoyed the little bit of learning on the funnctional programming paradime.
I saw the power of functions when it comes to organization and breaking complex tasks into
blocks of code that do one thing very well.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

I really don't see the value in smaller projects such as the ones we have done in class.
I can however see the value epecially when working with huge code bases.



3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

When I find a problem in code that I need to fix I always like to read out what the code is
doing as if I was describing the code to a teammate, I fix the logic if I recognize anything.
I then use print statements mostly as I have not found the extreme need for a debuger or test functions
that seem to be critical in bigger enviroments and compiled langueges.
